<p>&nbsp;</p>

There are many reasons why you might
want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph,
illustration, diagram, or chart.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
There are several things to consider when selecting and
preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them
right will make it look more attractive and professional.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
>> You can also use CSS to include images in your pages using the
background-image property
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### How Choosing Images for Your Site

A picture can say a thousand words, and great
images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one.and the image should be .

- Be relevant
- Convey information
- Convey the right mood
- Be instantly recognisable
- Fit the color palette

### How to Adding Images

To add an image into the page
you need to use an \<img>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
1. ***src*** :
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site. (Here you can see that
the images are in a child folder
called images
2. ***alt***:
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.
3. ***title***:
You can also use the title
attribute with the \<img> element
to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.

The properties that allow you to control
the appearance of text can be split into
two groups:

1. Those that directly affect the font and its appearance(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,
and the size of the text) 
2. Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters)
>> The formatting of your text can have a significant effect
on how readable your pages are.
to know how to editing and format texts you have to read in the same book Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)
