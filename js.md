JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
jQuery is automatically optimized to work with a lot of browsers. But, JavaScript is still dealing with some issues such as cross-browser compatibility. This can be due to poor JavaScript implementation practices by web browser developers.
