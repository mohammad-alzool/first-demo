<p>&nbsp;</p>

HTML5 is a [markup](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-08/) language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.

- ## WHY HTML5 ?
>because The Coding is Simplified
The core objectives of HTML5 are to offer increased multimedia support, and also make the coding much easier to read and understand for both people and machines. HTML5 coding is clear, simple, and descriptive. Rather than having to write enormous blocks of complicated coding, you can create the same thing using smaller chunks of simple coding.

HTML5 also makes placing audio and video content a breeze. It treats that content the same as it would with image tags, and this makes things a lot easier on coders because it allows them to include those multimedia elements without having to use a plugin or API. Clearer coding also means that HTML5 is much easier to troubleshoot than its predecessors.
The one caveat with the new \<audio> and \<video> tags is they support several different file formats, so you will need to include different versions of the multimedia you upload. With Flashall you had to do was upload an FLV or F4V file, but now you have to include all those various formats to accommodate the many devices and browsers that your users will be using.[source](https://www.b2bnn.com/2015/03/4-reasons-business-use-html5/#:~:text=HTML5%20coding%20is%20clear%2C%20simple%2C%20and%20descriptive.&text=HTML5%20also%20makes%20placing%20audio,use%20a%20plugin%20or%20API.)

# HTML5 Document Structure
![html5structure](/img/htmlstructure.png)
An HTML 5 document mainly consists of a Head and Body. The Head contains the data, which informs the browser and even web servers that it is an HTML 5 document. On the other hand, the Body contains content that web browsers actually display.

Each and every HTML 5 document employs a unique combination of elements and content to define a page. The structure of all the property documented pages is the same and contains:


- A declaration at the top, which indicates that it is an HTML 5 document
- A document header
- A document body

### HTML5 Example with basic Tags

\<!DOCTYPE HTML>&nbsp;

\<html>&nbsp;

\<head>&nbsp;

\<meta charset="utf-8">&nbsp;

\<title>Basic Page Structure</title>&nbsp;

\</head>&nbsp;

\<body>&nbsp;

\</body>&nbsp;

\</html>

# JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java.

JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.

## Why learn JavaScript?
The most obvious reason for learning JavaScript is if you have hopes of becoming a web developer. Even if you haven’t got your heart set on a tech career, being proficient in JavaScript will enable you to build websites from scratch—a pretty useful skill to have in today’s job market!

If you do want to become a web developer, here are some of the main reasons why you should learn JavaScript .

## JavaScript is beginner-friendly

Compared to many other programming languages, JavaScript offers one of the more beginner-friendly entry points into the world of coding. The great thing about JavaScript is that it comes installed on every modern web browser—there’s no need to set up any kind of development environment, which means you can start coding with JavaScript right away!

Another advantage of learning JavaScript as your first programming language is that you get instant feedback; with a minimal amount of JavaScript code, you’ll immediately see visible results. There’s also a huge JavaScript community on sites like Stack [Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript), so you’ll find plenty of support as you learn.
